They may need the possibility to transform long explanations into more understandable short explanations. In this paper, we discuss an approach to explain reasoning over Linked Data. We introduce a vocabulary to describe explanation related metadata and we discuss how publishing these metadata as Linked Data enables explaining reasoning over Linked Data. Finally, we present an approach to summarize these explanations taking into account user specified explanation filtering criteria.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/rakebul-hasan"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/139"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/133","title":"Distributed Keyword Search over RDF via MapReduce","abstract":"Non expert users need support to access linked data available on the Web. To this aim, keyword-based search is considered an essential feature of database systems.The distributed nature of the Semantic Web demands query processing techniques to evolve towards a scenario where data is scattered on distributed data stores. Existing approaches to keyword search cannot guarantee scalability in a distributed environment, because, at runtime, they are unaware of the location of the relevant data to the query and thus, they cannot optimize join tasks.In this paper, we illustrate a novel distributed approach to keyword search over RDF data that exploits the MapReduce paradigm by switching the problem from graph-parallel to data-parallel processing. Moreover, our framework is able to consider ranking during the building phase to return directly the best (top-k) answers in the first (k) generated results, reducing greatly the overall computational load and complexity.Finally, a comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach exhibits very good efficiency guaranteeing high level of accuracy, especially with respect to state-of-the-art competitors.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/roberto-de-virgilio","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/antonio-maccioni"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/133"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/134","title":"A Probabilistic Approach for Integrating Heterogeneous Knowledge Sources","abstract":"In the past years, open-domain Information Extraction (IE) systems like Nell and  ReVerb have achieved impressive results by harvesting massive amounts of machine-readable knowledge with minimal supervision. However, the knowledge bases they  produce still lack a clean, explicit semantic data model. This, on the other hand, could be provided by full-fledged semantic networks like DBpedia or Yago, which, in turn, would benefit from the additional coverage provided by Web-scale IE. In this paper, we bring these two strains of research together, and present a method to align terms from Nell with instances in DBpedia. Our approach is unsupervised in nature and relies on two key components. First, we automatically acquire probabilistic type information for Nell terms given a set of matching hypotheses. Second, we view the mapping task as the statistical inference problem of finding the most likely coherent mapping – i.e., the maximum a posteriori (MAP) mapping – based on the outcome of the first component used as soft constraint. These two steps are highly intertwined: accordingly, we propose an approach that iteratively refines type acquisition based on the output of the mapping generator, and vice versa. Experimental results on gold-standard data indicate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline, and is able to produce ever-improving mappings consistently across iterations.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/arnab-dutta","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/christian-meilicke","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/simone-ponzetto"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/134"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/154","title":"Identifying diachronic topic-based research communities by clustering shared research trajectories","abstract":"Communities of academic authors are usually identified by means of standard community detection algorithms, which exploit ‘static’ relations, such as co-authorship or citation networks. In contrast with these approaches, here we focus on diachronic topic-based communities –i.e., communities of people who appear to work on semantically related topics at the same time. These communities are interesting because their analysis allows us to make sense of the dynamics of the research world –e.g., migration of researchers from one topic to another, new communities being spawn by older ones, communities splitting, merging, ceasing to exist, etc. To this purpose, we are interested in developing clustering methods that are able to handle correctly the dynamic aspects of topic-based community formation, prioritizing the relationship between researchers who appear to follow the same research trajectories. We thus present a novel approach called Temporal Semantic Topic-Based Clustering (TST), which exploits a novel metric for clustering researchers according to their research trajectories, defined as distributions of semantic topics over time. The approach has been evaluated through an empirical study involving 25 experts from the Semantic Web and Human-Computer Interaction areas. The evaluation shows that TST exhibits a performance comparable to the one achieved by human experts.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/francesco-osborne","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/giuseppe-scavo","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/enrico-motta"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/154"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/108","title":"Leveraging Distributed Human Computation and Consensus Partition for Entity Coreference","abstract":"Entity coreference is important to Linked Data integration. User involvement is considered as a valuable source of human knowledge that helps identify coreferent entities. However, the quality of user involvement is not always satisfying, which significantly diminishes the coreference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new approach called coCoref, which leverages distributed human computation and consensus partition for entity coreference. Consensus partition is used to aggregate all distributed user-judged coreference results and resolve their disagreements. To alleviate user involvement, ensemble learning is performed on the consensus partition to automatically identify coreferent entities that users have not judged. We integrate coCoref into an online Linked Data browsing system, so that users can participate in entity coreference with their daily Web activities. Our empirical evaluation shows that coCoref largely improves the accuracy of user-judged coreference results, and reduces user involvement by automatically identifying a large number of coreferent entities.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/saisai-gong","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/wei-hu","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/yuzhong-qu"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/108"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/31","title":"Seeding Structured Data by Default via Open Source Library Systems","abstract":"Most libraries use the machine-readable cataloguing (MARC) format to encode andexchange metadata about the items they make available to their patrons.Traditional library systems have not published this data on the Semantic Web.However, some agile open source library systems have begun closing thisgap by publishing structured data that uses the schema.org vocabulary todescribe the bibliographic data, make offers for items available for loan, andlink the items to their owning libraries.

We call them trusty URIs and we show how they can be used for approaches like nanopublications to make not only specific resources but their entire reference trees verifiable. Digital artifacts can be identified not only on the byte level but on more abstract levels such as RDF graphs, which means that resources keep their hash values even when presented in a different format. Our approach sticks to the core principles of the web, namely openness and decentralized architecture, is fully compatible with existing standards and protocols, and can therefore be used right away. Evaluation of our reference implementations shows that these desired properties are indeed accomplished by our approach, and that it remains practical even for very large files.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/tobias-kuhn","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/michel-dumontier"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/106"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/211","title":"NL-Graphs: A Hybrid Approach toward Interactively Querying Semantic Data","abstract":"A variety of query approaches have been proposed by the semantic web community to explore and query semantic data. Each was developed for a specific task and employed its own interaction mechanism; each query mechanism has its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Most semantic web search systems employ only one approach, thus being unable to exploit the benefits of alternative approaches. Motivated by a usability and interactivity perspective, we propose to combine two query approaches (graph-based and natural language) as a hybrid query approach. In this paper, we present NL-Graphs which aims to exploit the strengths of both approaches, while ameliorating their weaknesses. NL-Graphs was conceptualised and developed from observations, and lessons learned, in several evaluations with expert and casual users. The results of evaluating our approach with expert and casual users on a large semantic dataset are very encouraging; both types of users were highly satisfied and could effortlessly use the hybrid approach to formulate and answer queries. Indeed, success rates showed they were able to successfully answer all the evaluation questions.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/khadija-elbedweihy","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/suvodeep-mazumdar","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/stuart-n-wrigley","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/fabio-ciravegna"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/211"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/127","title":"Dedalo: looking for Clusters Explanations in a Labyrinth of Linked Data","abstract":"We present Dedalo, a framework which is able to exploit Linked Data to generate explanations for clusters. In general, any result of a Knowledge Discovery process, including clusters, is interpreted by human experts who use  their background knowledge to explain them. However, for someone without such expert knowledge, those results may be difficult to understand. Obtaining a complete and satisfactory explanation becomes a laborious and time-consuming process, involving expertise in possibly different domains.Having said so, not only does the Web of Data contain vast amounts of such background knowledge, but it also natively connects those domains. While the efforts put in the interpretation process can be reduced with the support of Linked Data, how to automatically access the right piece of knowledge in such a big space remains an issue.Dedalo is a framework that dynamically traverses Linked Data to find commonalities that form explanations for items of a cluster. We have developed  different strategies (or heuristics) to guide this traversal, reducing the time to get the best explanation. In our experiments, we compare those strategies and demonstrate that Dedalo finds relevant and sophisticated Linked Data explanations from different areas.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/ilaria-tiddi","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/mathieu-daquin","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/enrico-motta"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/127"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/36","title":"conTEXT -- Lightweight Text Analytics using Linked Data","abstract":"The Web democratized publishing -- everybody can easily publish information on a Website, Blog, in social networks or microblogging systems. The more the amount of published information grows, the more important are technologies for accessing, analysing, summarising and visualising information. While substantial progress has been made in the last years in each of these areas individually, we argue, that only the intelligent combination of approaches will make this progress truly useful and leverage further synergies between techniques. In this paper we develop a text analytics architecture of participation, which allows ordinary people to use sophisticated NLP techniques for analysing and visualizing their content, be it a Blog, Twitter feed, Website or article collection. The architecture comprises interfaces for information access, natural language processing and visualization. Different exchangeable components can be plugged into this architecture, making it easy to tailor for individual needs. We evaluate the usefulness of our approach by comparing both the effectiveness and efficiency of end users within a task-solving setting. Moreover, we evaluate the usability of our approach using a questionnaire-driven approach. Both evaluations suggest that ordinary Web users are empowered to analyse their data and perform tasks, which were previously out of reach.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/ali-khalili","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/soeren-auer","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/axel-cyrille-ngonga-ngomo"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/36"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/140","title":"Using Semantic and Domain-based Information in CLIR Systems","abstract":"Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems extend classic information retrieval mechanisms for allowing users to query across languages, i.e., to retrieve documents written in languages different from the language used for query formulation.In this paper, we present a CLIR system exploiting multilingual ontologies for enriching documents representation with multilingual semantic information during the indexing phase and for mapping query fragments to concepts during the retrieval phase.This system has been applied on a domain-specific document collection and the contribution of the ontologies to the CLIR system has been evaluated in conjunction with the use of both Microsoft Bing and Google Translate translation services.Results demonstrate that the use of domain-specific resources leads to a significant improvement of CLIR system performance.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/mauro-dragoni","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/alessio-bosca","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/matteo-casu","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/chiara-di-francescomarino"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/140"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/35","title":"Generating Synthetic RDF Data with Connected Blank Nodes for Benchmarking","abstract":"Generators for synthetic RDF datasets are very important for testing and benchmarking various  semantic data management tasks (e.g. querying, storage, update, compare, integrate). However, the current generators, like the Univ-Bench Artificial data generator (UBA), do not support sufficiently (or totally ignore) blank node connectivity issues. Blank nodes are used for various purposes (e.g. for  describing complex attributes), and a significant percentage of resources is currently represented with blank nodes. Moreover,  several   semantic data management tasks, like isomorphism checking (useful for checking equivalence), and blank node matching (useful in  comparison\/versioning\/synchronization, and in semantic similarity functions), not only have to deal with blank nodes, but their complexity  and optimality depends on the connectivity of blank nodes. To enable the comparative evaluation of the  various techniques for carrying out these tasks, in  this paper we present the design and implementation of a generator, called BGEN, which allows building data sets containing blank nodes with the desired complexity,  controllable through various features   (morphology, size, diameter, clustering coefficient). Finally, the paper reports experimental  results concerning the efficiency of the generator, as well as results from using the generated datasets, that demonstrate the value of the generator.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/christina-lantzaki","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/thanos-yannakis","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/yannis-tzitzikas","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/anastasia-analyti"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/35"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/16","title":"Matware: Constructing and Exploiting Domain Specific Warehouses  by Aggregating Semantic Data","abstract":"In many  applications one has to fetch  and assemble pieces of information coming from more than one web sources such as SPARQL endpoints.

Based on the introduced concepts, additional levels of parallelization can be proposed that benefit from the use of multiple parallel devices. Furthermore, we introduce a concept to reduce the amount of invalid triple derivations like duplicates. We evaluate our concepts by applying different rulesets to the real-world DBPedia dataset as well as to the synthetic Lehigh University benchmark ontology (LUBM) with up to 1.1 billion triples.

An Evaluation of Editing Approaches to Construct R2RML Mappings","abstract":"R2RML defines a language to express mappings from relational data to RDF. That way, applications built on top of the W3C Semantic Technology stack can seamlessly integrate relational data using those mappings. A major obstacle to using R2RML, though, is the effort for manually curating the mappings. In particular in scenarios that aim to map data from huge and complex relational schemata to more abstract ontologies efficient ways to support the mapping creation are needed.In previous work we presented a mapping editor that aims to reduce the effort that users need to invest for mapping creation. While assisting users in mapping construction the editor also imposed a fixed editing approach, which turned out to be not optimal for all users and all kinds of mapping tasks. Most prominently, it is unclear on which of the two data models users should best start with the mapping construction. In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive user study that evaluates different alternative editing approaches for constructing R2RML mapping rules.

Such a shift in representation can help to get new insights into the data, to discover related attributes, or to find a more con- cise description of the entities of interest. Allowing the alternative descriptions furthermore to be close approximations of the original entity set leads to more flexibility in finding such insights. Our approach is based on the construction of parallel formal concept lattices over different sets of attributes for the same en- tities. Between the formal concepts in the parallel lattices, we define mappings which constitute approximations of the extent of the concepts. In this paper, we formalize the idea of two types of mappings between formal concept lattices, provide an implementation of these mappings and evaluate their ability of finding alternative descriptions on several real-world RDF data sets for one concrete set- ting of finding alternative descriptions for entities described by RDF class types which are based on properties.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/thomas-gottron","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/ansgar-scherp","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/stefan-scheglmann"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/73"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/145","title":"Towards Competency Question-driven Ontology Authoring","abstract":"Ontology authoring is a non-trivial task for novice authors who are not proficient in logics.

We ﬁrst analyse real-world competency questions collected from two different domains. Analysis shows that many of them can be categorised into several frequent patterns that differ along a set of features. Then we employ the notion of presupposition from linguistics to describe the ontology requirements implied by competency questions, and show that these presuppositions can be tested automatically.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/yuan-ren","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/artemis-parvizi","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/chris-mellish","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/jeff-z-pan","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/kees-van-deemter","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/robert-stevens"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/145"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/76","title":"WaterFowl: a Compact, Self-indexed and Inference-enabled RDF Store","abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel approach – called WaterFowl – for the storage of RDF triples that addresses some key issues inthe contexts of big data and the Semantic Web.

However, the initial implementation and experiments were very preliminary and hence it is currently unclear whether the approach can be applied to large and complex ontologies. Moreover, the approach so far can only support instance queries. In the current paper we thoroughly investigate repairing as an approach to scalable (and complete) ontology-based data access.

Second, we show how (arbitrary) conjunctive queries can be supported by integrating well-known query rewriting techniques with OWL 2 RL systems via repairing. Third, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation obtaining encouraging results. In more detail, our results show that we can compute repairs even for very large real-world ontologies in a reasonable amount of time, that the performance overhead introduced by repairing is negligible in small to medium sized ontologies and noticeable but manageable in large and complex one, and that the hybrid reasoning approach can very efficiently compute the correct answers for real-world challenging scenarios.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/giorgos-stoilos"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/146"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/50","title":"HiBISCuS: Hypergraph-Based Source Selection for SPARQL Endpoint Federation","abstract":"Efficient federated query processing is of significant importance to tame the large amount of data available on the Web of Data.

Profiles are generated through the configuration of techniques for resource sampling from datasets, topic extraction from knowledge bases and their ranking based on graphical models. To enable a good trade-off between scalability and representatives of generated data, appropriate parameters are determined experimentally.

The goal of this paper is to show that data-driven eviction outperforms today’s dominant data-agnostic approaches such as first-in-first-out or random deletion.Specifically, we first introduce a method called Clock that evicts data from a join cache based on the likelihood estimate of contributing to a join in the future.

Increasingly, solutions to coreference resolution have humans in the loop. For instance, many active learning, crowdsourcing, and pay-as-you-go approaches solicit user feedback for verifying candidate coreferent entities computed by automatic methods. Whereas reducing the number of verification tasks is a major consideration for these approaches, very little attention has been paid to the efficiency of performing each single verification task. To address this issue, in this paper, instead of showing the entire descriptions of two entities for verification which are possibly lengthy, we propose to extract and present a compact summary of them, and expect that such length-limited comparative entity summaries can help human users verify more efficiently without significantly hurting the accuracy of their verification. Our approach exploits the common and different features of two entities that best help indicate (non-)coreference, and also considers the diverse information on their identities. Experimental results show that verification is 2.7--2.9 times faster when using our comparative entity summaries, and its accuracy is not notably affected.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/danyun-xu","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/gong-cheng","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/yuzhong-qu"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/26"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/65","title":"Object Property Matching utilizing the Overlap between Imported Ontologies","abstract":"Large scale Linked Data is often based on relational databases and thereby tends to be modeled with rich object properties, specifying the exact relationship between two objects, rather than a generic is-a or part-of relationship. We study this phenomenon on government issued statistical data, where a vested interest exists in matching such object properties for data integration. We leverage the fact that while the labeling of the properties is often heterogeneous, e.g. ex1:geo and ex2:location, they link to individuals of semantically similar code lists, e.g. country lists. State-of-the-art ontology matching tools do not use this effect and therefore tend to miss the possible correspondences. We enhance the state-of-the-art matching process by aligning the individuals of such imported ontologies separately and computing the overlap between them to improve the matching of the object properties. The matchers themselves are used as black boxes and are thus interchangeable. The new correspondences found with this method lead to an increase of recall up to 2.5 times on real world data, with only a minor loss in precision.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/benjamin-zapilko","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/brigitte-mathiak"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/65"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/244","title":"PCS2OWL: A Generic Approach for Deriving Web Ontologies from Product Classification Systems","abstract":"The classification of products and services enables reliable and efficient electronic exchanges of product data across organizations. Many companies classify products (a) according to generic or industry-specific product classification standards, or (b) by using proprietary category systems. Such classification systems often contain thousands of product classes that are updated at regular intervals. This implies a large quantity of useful information which the e-commerce Web of Data could immediately benefit from. Thus, instead of building up product ontologies from scratch, which is costly, tedious, error-prone, and high-maintenance, it is generally easier to derive them from existing classifications. In this paper, we (1) describe a generic, semi-automated method for deriving OWL ontologies from product classification standards and proprietary category systems. Moreover, we (2) show that our approach generates logically and semantically correct vocabularies, and (3) present the practical benefit of our approach.

In short, they are technical means that suggest potentially relevant products and services to the users of a Web site, typically a shop. The recommendations are computed in advance or during the actual visit and use various types of data as input, in particular past purchases and the purchasing behavior of other users with similar preferences. One major problem with recommender systems is that the quality of recommendations depends on the amount, quality, and representativeness of the in-formation about items already owned by the visitor, e.g. from past purchases at that particular shop. For first-time visitors and customers migrating from other merchants, the amount of available information is often too small to generate good recommendations. In other words, shopping history data for a single user is fragmented and spread over multiple sites, and cannot be actively exposed by the user himself to additional shops. This creates strong lock-in effects for consumers, because they cannot migrate from one merchant to another without losing access to high-quality recommendations, and it creates strong market entry barriers for new merchants, since they do not have access to the customers’ shopping history with other shops. In this paper, we propose to use Semantic Web technology, namely GoodRelations and schema.org, to empower e-commerce customers to (1) collect and manage ownership information about products, (2) advertise interest in sharing this information with shop sites in exchange for better recommendations or oth-er incentives, and (3) expose the information to such shop sites directly from their browser. We then sketch how a shop site could use the ownership infor-mation to propose relevant products.

User support for building data analysis workflows, however, has not progressed sufficiently: the large number of operators currently available in KDD systems and interactions between these operators complicates successful data analysis.To help Data Miners we enhanced one of the most used open source data mining tools---RapidMiner---with semantic technologies. Specifically, we first annotated all elements involved in the Data Mining (DM) process---the data, the operators, models, data mining tasks, and KDD workflows---semantically using our eProPlan modelling tool that allows to describe operators and build a task\/method decomposition grammar to specify the desired workflows embedded in an ontology. Second, we enhanced RapidMiner to employ these semantic annotations to actively support data analysts. Third, we built an Intelligent Discovery Assistant, eIDA, that leverages the semantic annotation as well as HTN planning to automatically support KDD process generation.We found that the use of Semantic Web approaches and technologies in the KDD domain helped us to lower the barrier to data analysis. We also found that using a generic ontology editor overwhelmed KDD-centric users. We, therefore, provided them with problem-centric extensions to protege. Last and most surprising, we found that our semantic modeling of the KDD domain served as a rapid prototyping approach for several hard-coded improvements of RapidMiner, namely correctness checking of workflows and quick-fixes, reinforcing the finding that even a little semantic modeling can go a long way in improving the understanding of a domain even for domain experts.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/joerg-uwe-kietz","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/floarea-serban","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/simon-fischer","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/abraham-bernstein"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/47"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/192","title":"SPARQL Query Verbalization for Explaining Semantic Search Engine Queries","abstract":"In this paper we introduce Spartiqulation, a system that translates SPARQL queries into English text.

The experiments have shown accurate and consistent prediction of road traffic conditions, main benefits of the semantic encoding.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/freddy-lecue","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/robert-tucker","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/veli-bicer","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/pierpaolo-tommasi","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/simone-tallevi-diotallevi","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/marco-luca-sbodio"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/205"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/67","title":"Survey on Common Strategies of Vocabulary Reuse in Linked Open Data Modeling","abstract":"The choice of which vocabulary to reuse when modeling and publishing Linked Open Data (LOD) is far from trivial. Until today, there is no study that investigates the different strategies of reusing vocabularies for LOD modeling.In this paper, we present the results of a survey with 79 participants that examines the most preferred strategies of vocabulary reuse of LOD modeling. Participants of our survey are LOD publishers and practitioners. Their task was to assess different vocabulary reuse strategies and explain their ranking decision. We found significant differences between the modeling strategies that range from reusing popular vocabularies, minimizing the number of vocabularies, and staying within one domain vocabulary. A very interesting insight is that the popularity in terms of how many data sources use a vocabulary is more important than total occurrence of individual classes and properties in the LOD cloud. Overall, the results of this survey help in better understanding the strategies how data engineers reuse vocabularies and may be used to develop future vocabulary engineering tools.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/johann-schaible","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/thomas-gottron","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/ansgar-scherp"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/67"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/227","title":"User Interests Identification on Twitter Using a Hierarchical Knowledge Base","abstract":"Twitter, due to its massive growth as a social networking platform has been in focus to analyze its user generated content for personalization and recommendation tasks. A common challenge across these tasks is identifying user interests from tweets. Lately, semantic enrichment of Twitter posts to determine (entity-based) user interests has been an active area of research. The advantages of these approaches include interoperability, information reuse and the availability of knowledge-bases to be exploited. However, exploiting these knowledge bases for identifying user interests still remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on exploiting hierarchical relationships present in knowledge-bases to infer richer user interests expressed as \textit{Hierarchical Interest Graph}. We argue that the hierarchical semantics of concepts can enhance the existing systems to personalize or recommend items based on varied level of conceptual abstractness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study which shows an average of approximately eight of the top ten weighted hierarchical interests in the graph being relevant to a given user's interests.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/pavan-kapanipathi","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/prateek-jain","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/chitra-venkataramani","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/amit-sheth"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/227"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/224","title":"Accepting the XBRL Challenge with Linked Data for Financial Data Integration","abstract":"Analysts spend a disproportionate amount of time with financial data curation before they are able to compare company performances in an analysis. The Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for annotating financial facts is suited for automatic processing to increase information quality in financial analytics. Still, XBRL does not solve the problem of data integration as required for a holistic view on companies. Semantic Web technologies promise benefits for financial data integration, yet, existing literature lacks concrete case studies. In this paper, we present the Financial Information Observation System (FIOS) that uses Linked Data and multidimensional modelling based on the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary for accessing and representing relevant financial data. FIOS fulfils the information seeking mantra of ``overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand'', integrates yearly and quarterly balance sheets, daily NASDAQ stock quotes as well as company and industry background information and helps analysts creating their own analyses with Excel-like functionality.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/benedikt-kaempgen","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/tobias-weller","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/sean-oriain","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/craig-weber","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/andreas-harth"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/224"},{"id":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/20","title":"Optimising Linked Data Queries Using Runtime Statistics in the Presence of Co-reference","abstract":"Due to the distributed nature of Linked Data, many resources are referred to by more than one URI. This phenomenon, known as co-reference, increases the probability of leaving out implicit semantically related results when querying Linked Data. The probability of co-reference increases further when considering distributed SPARQL queries over a larger set of distributed datasets. Addressing co-reference in Linked Data queries, on one hand, increases complexity of query processing. On the other hand, it requires changes in how statistics of datasets are taken into consideration. We investigate these two challenges of addressing co-reference in distributed SPARQL queries, and propose two methods to improve query efficiency: 1) a model named Virtual Graph, that transforms a query with co-reference into a normal query with pre-existing bindings; 2) an algorithm named $Psi$, that intensively exploits parallelism, and dynamically optimises queries using runtime statistics. We deploy both methods in an distributed engine called LHD-d. To evaluate LHD-d, we investigate the distribution of co-reference in the real world, based on which we simulate an experimental RDF network. In this environment we demonstrate the advantages of LHD-d for distributed SPARQL queries in environments with co-reference.","authors":["http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/xin-wang","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/thanassis-tiropanis","http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/person\/hugh-c-davis"],"title":"#eswc2015","thumbnail":null,"track":"Research Track","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2015\/paper\/research\/20"}],
