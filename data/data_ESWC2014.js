That way, applications built on top of the W3C Semantic Technology stack can seamlessly integrate relational data using those mappings. A major obstacle to using R2RML, though, is the effort for manually curating the mappings. In particular in scenarios that aim to map data from huge and complex relational schemata to more abstract ontologies efficient ways to support the mapping creation are needed. In previous work we presented a mapping editor that aims to reduce the effort that users need to invest for mapping creation. While assisting users in mapping construction the editor also imposed a fixed editing approach, which turned out to be not optimal for all users and all kinds of mapping tasks. Most prominently, it is unclear on which of the two data models users should best start with the mapping construction. In this paper, we present the results of a comprehensive user study that evaluates different alternative editing approaches for constructing R2RML mapping rules. In the user study we measure the efficiency and quality of the mapping construction to find out which approach works better for users with different background knowledge and for different types of tasks in order to extend our editor.","id":1142,"authors":["2489","2464","262","2889","2495","2788"],"title":"How to Best Find a Partner?

In short, they are technical means that suggest potentially relevant products and services to the users of a Web site, typically a shop. The recommendations are computed in advance or during the actual visit and use various types of data as input, in particular past purchases and the purchasing behavior of other users with similar preferences. One major problem with recommender systems is that the quality of recommendations depends on the amount, quality, and representativeness of the in-formation about items already owned by the visitor, e.g. from past purchases at that particular shop. For first-time visitors and customers migrating from other merchants, the amount of available information is often too small to generate good recommendations. In other words, shopping history data for a single user is fragmented and spread over multiple sites, and cannot be actively exposed by the user himself to additional shops. This creates strong lock-in effects for consumers, because they cannot migrate from one merchant to another without losing access to high-quality recommendations, and it creates strong market entry barriers for new merchants, since they do not have access to the customers\u2019 shopping history with other shops. In this paper, we propose to use Semantic Web technology, namely GoodRelations and schema.org, to empower e-commerce customers to (1) collect and manage ownership information about products, (2) advertise interest in sharing this information with shop sites in exchange for better recommendations or oth-er incentives, and (3) expose the information to such shop sites directly from their browser. We then sketch how a shop site could use the ownership infor-mation to propose relevant products.","id":154,"authors":["2612","2245"],"title":"Towards Portable Shopping Histories: Using GoodRelations

User support for building data analysis workflows, however, has not progressed sufficiently: the large number of operators currently available in KDD systems and interactions between these operators complicates successful data analysis. To help Data Miners we enhanced one of the most used open source data mining tools---RapidMiner---with semantic technologies. Specifically, we first annotated all elements involved in the Data Mining (DM) process---the data, the operators, models, data mining tasks, and KDD workflows---semantically using our eProPlan modelling tool that allows to describe operators and build a task\/method decomposition grammar to specify the desired workflows embedded in an ontology. Second, we enhanced RapidMiner to employ these semantic annotations to actively support data analysts. Third, we built an Intelligent Discovery Assistant, eIDA, that leverages the semantic annotation as well as HTN planning to automatically support KDD process generation. We found that the use of Semantic Web approaches and technologies in the KDD domain helped us to lower the barrier to data analysis. We also found that using a generic ontology editor overwhelmed KDD-centric users. We, therefore, provided them with problem-centric extensions to protege. Last and most surprising, we found that our semantic modeling of the KDD domain served as a rapid prototyping approach for several hard-coded improvements of RapidMiner, namely correctness checking of workflows and quick-fixes, reinforcing the finding that even a little semantic modeling can go a long way in improving the understanding of a domain even for domain experts.","id":110,"authors":["2475","2806","299","2284"],"title":"\"Semantics Inside!\" But let's not tell the Data Miners: Intelligent Support for Data Mining","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Kietz","track":"In-Use Track","twitter_widget":"453648885060075520","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/in-use\/47"},{"abstract":"The Web democratized publishing -- everybody can easily publish information on a Website, Blog, in social networks or microblogging systems.

While substantial progress has been made in the last years in each of these areas individually, we argue, that only the intelligent combination of approaches will make this progress truly useful and leverage further synergies between techniques. In this paper we develop a text analytics architecture of participation, which allows ordinary people to use sophisticated NLP techniques for analysing and visualizing their content, be it a Blog, Twitter feed, Website or article collection. The architecture comprises interfaces for information access, natural language processing and visualization. Different exchangeable components can be plugged into this architecture, making it easy to tailor for individual needs. We evaluate the usefulness of our approach by comparing both the effectiveness and efficiency of end users within a task-solving setting. Moreover, we evaluate the usability of our approach using a questionnaire-driven approach. Both evaluations suggest that ordinary Web users are empowered to analyse their data and perform tasks, which were previously out of reach.","id":167,"authors":["2228","2525","2862"],"title":"conTEXT -- Lightweight Text Analytics using Linked Data","thumbnail":"app\/img\/papers\/in-use\/logo_small.png.jpg","hashtag":"#eswc2014Khalili","track":"In-Use Track","twitter_widget":"453644274425278464","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/in-use\/36"},{"abstract":"Most libraries use the machine-readable cataloguing (MARC) format to encode and exchange metadata about the items they make available to their patrons. Traditional library systems have not published this data on the Semantic Web. However, some agile open source library systems have begun closing this gap by publishing structured data that uses the schema.org vocabulary to describe the bibliographic data, make offers for items available for loan, and link the items to their owning libraries. This article distills the lessons learned from implementing structured data in Evergreen, Koha, and VuFind; highlights emerging design patterns for publishing structured data in other library systems; and traces the influence these implementation experiences have had on the evolution of the schema.org vocabulary. Finally, we discuss the impact that \"the power of the default\" publishing of structured data could have on discoverability of library offerings on the Semantic Web.","id":1195,"authors":["2785"],"title":"Seeding Structured Data by Default via Open Source Library Systems","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Scott","track":"In-Use Track","twitter_widget":"453643566674235392","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/in-use\/31"},{"abstract":"In many applications one has to fetch and assemble pieces of information coming from more than one web sources such as SPARQL endpoints.

Subsequently, we present MatWare (MATerialized WAreshouse), a tool that we have developed for automating the construction of such warehouses, for assessing their value and for automating their reconstruction.

In particular we present a system which integrates numerous sensors (exposing heterogenous, exogenous and raw data streams such as weather information, road works, city events or incidents) to improve accuracy and consistency of traffic congestion prediction. Our prototype of semantics-aware prediction, being used and experimented currently by traffic controllers in Dublin City Ireland, works efficiently with real, live and heterogeneous stream data.

The Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) for annotating financial facts is suited for automatic processing to increase information quality in financial analytics. Still, XBRL does not solve the problem of data integration as required for a holistic view on companies. Semantic Web technologies promise benefits for financial data integration, yet, existing literature lacks concrete case studies. In this paper, we present the Financial Information Observation System (FIOS) that uses Linked Data and multidimensional modelling based on the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary for accessing and representing relevant financial data. FIOS fulfils the information seeking mantra of ``overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand'', integrates yearly and quarterly balance sheets, daily NASDAQ stock quotes as well as company and industry background information and helps analysts creating their own analyses with Excel-like functionality.","id":1208,"authors":["2411","256","298","2723","2441"],"title":"Accepting the XBRL Challenge with Linked Data for Financial Data Integration","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Kampgen","track":"In-Use Track","twitter_widget":"453668992188547072","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/in-use\/224"},{"abstract":"The classification of products and services enables reliable and efficient electronic exchanges of product data across organizations. Many companies classify products (a) according to generic or industry-specific product classification standards, or (b) by using proprietary category systems. Such classification systems often contain thousands of product classes that are updated at regular intervals. This implies a large quantity of useful information which the e-commerce Web of Data could immediately benefit from. Thus, instead of building up product ontologies from scratch, which is costly, tedious, error-prone, and high-maintenance, it is generally easier to derive them from existing classifications. In this paper, we (1) describe a generic, semi-automated method for deriving OWL ontologies from product classification standards and proprietary category systems. Moreover, we (2) show that our approach generates logically and semantically correct vocabularies, and (3) present the practical benefit of our approach. The resulting product ontologies are compatible with the GoodRelations vocabulary for e-commerce and with schema.org and can be used to enrich product and offer descriptions on the Semantic Web, allowing for better product searches.","id":179,"authors":["2154","2245","2484","2321"],"title":"PCS2OWL: A Generic Approach for Deriving Web Ontologies from Product Classification

We thus present a novel approach called Temporal Semantic Topic-Based Clustering (TST), which exploits a novel metric for clustering researchers according to their research trajectories, defined as distributions of semantic topics over time. The approach has been evaluated through an empirical study involving 25 experts from the Semantic Web and Human-Computer Interaction areas.

In this paper, we bring these two strains of research together, and present a method to align terms from Nell with instances in DBpedia. Our approach is unsupervised in nature and relies on two key components. First, we automatically acquire probabilistic type information for Nell terms given a set of matching hypotheses. Second, we view the mapping task as the statistical inference problem of finding the most likely coherent mapping \u2013 i.e., the maximum a posteriori (MAP) mapping \u2013 based on the outcome of the first component used as soft constraint. These two steps are highly intertwined: accordingly, we propose an approach that iteratively refines type acquisition based on the output of the mapping generator, and vice versa.

Obtaining a complete and satisfactory explanation becomes a laborious and time-consuming process, involving expertise in possibly different domains. Having said so, not only does the Web of Data contain vast amounts of such background knowledge, but it also natively connects those domains. While the efforts put in the interpretation process can be reduced with the support of Linked Data, how to automatically access the right piece of knowledge in such a big space remains an issue. Dedalo is a framework that dynamically traverses Linked Data to find commonalities that form explanations for items of a cluster. We have developed different strategies (or heuristics) to guide this traversal, reducing the time to get the best explanation. In our experiments, we compare those strategies and demonstrate that Dedalo finds relevant and sophisticated Linked Data explanations from different areas.","id":1128,"authors":["2100","2268","2291"],"title":"Dedalo: looking for Clusters Explanations in a Labyrinth of Linked Data","thumbnail":"app\/img\/papers\/research\/127.jpeg","hashtag":"#eswc2014Tiddi","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453671869841817600","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/127"},{"abstract":"Description Logics have been extensively studied from the viewpoint of decidability and computational tractability.

Such a shift in representation can help to get new insights into the data, to discover related attributes, or to find a more con- cise description of the entities of interest. Allowing the alternative descriptions furthermore to be close approximations of the original entity set leads to more flexibility in finding such insights. Our approach is based on the construction of parallel formal concept lattices over different sets of attributes for the same en- tities. Between the formal concepts in the parallel lattices, we define mappings which constitute approximations of the extent of the concepts. In this paper, we formalize the idea of two types of mappings between formal concept lattices, provide an implementation of these mappings and evaluate their ability of finding alternative descriptions on several real-world RDF data sets for one concrete set- ting of finding alternative descriptions for entities described by RDF class types which are based on properties.","id":169,"authors":["2205","2566","2592"],"title":"Providing Alternative Declarative Descriptions for Entity Sets using Parallel Concept Lattices","thumbnail":"app\/img\/papers\/research\/440px-Balloons-aj.svg.png.jpg","hashtag":"#eswc2014GottronTC","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453668253940723712","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/73"},{"abstract":null,"id":1136,"authors":["2599","2879","2240","2362"],"title":"Mapping Representation based on Meta-data and SPIN for Localization Workflows","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#WASABI2014Meehan","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469436119189188609","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/WASABI\/4"},{"abstract":null,"id":1132,"authors":["2481"],"title":"IRIS: A Protege Plug-in to Extract and Serialize Product Attribute Name-Value Pairs","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#WASABI2014Ozcar","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469436030492233728","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/WASABI\/3"},{"abstract":"Background knowledge about the application domain can be used in event processing in order to improve processing quality. The idea of semantic enrichment is to incorporate background knowledge into events, thereby generating enriched events which in the next processing step can be better understood by event processing engines. In this paper, we present an efficient technique for event stream enrichment by planning multi-step event enrichment and processing. Our optimization goal is to minimize event enrichment costs while meeting application-specific service expectations. The event enrichment is optimized to avoid unnecessary event stream enrichment without missing any complex events of interest.

Until today, there is no study that investigates the different strategies of reusing vocabularies for LOD modeling.In this paper, we present the results of a survey with 79 participants that examines the most preferred strategies of vocabulary reuse of LOD modeling. Participants of our survey are LOD publishers and practitioners. Their task was to assess different vocabulary reuse strategies and explain their ranking decision. We found significant differences between the modeling strategies that range from reusing popular vocabularies, minimizing the number of vocabularies, and staying within one domain vocabulary. A very interesting insight is that the popularity in terms of how many data sources use a vocabulary is more important than total occurrence of individual classes and properties in the LOD cloud. Overall, the results of this survey help in better understanding the strategies how data engineers reuse vocabularies and may be used to develop future vocabulary engineering tools.","id":115,"authors":["2503","2205","2592"],"title":"Survey on Common Strategies of Vocabulary Reuse in Linked Open Data Modeling","thumbnail":"app\/img\/papers\/research\/67.png.jpg","hashtag":"#eswc2014Schaible","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453650392564240385","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/67"},{"abstract":"Large scale Linked Data is often based on relational databases and thereby tends to be modeled with rich object properties, specifying the exact relationship between two objects, rather than a generic is-a or part-of relationship. We study this phenomenon on government issued statistical data, where a vested interest exists in matching such object properties for data integration. We leverage the fact that while the labeling of the properties is often heterogeneous, e.g. ex1:geo and ex2:location, they link to individuals of semantically similar code lists, e.g. country lists. State-of-the-art ontology matching tools do not use this effect and therefore tend to miss the possible correspondences. We enhance the state-of-the-art matching process by aligning the individuals of such imported ontologies separately and computing the overlap between them to improve the matching of the object properties. The matchers themselves are used as black boxes and are thus interchangeable. The new correspondences found with this method lead to an increase of recall up to 2.5 times on real world data, with only a minor loss in precision.","id":1162,"authors":["2360","2593"],"title":"Object Property Matching utilizing the Overlap between Imported Ontologies","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Zapilko","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453650141820383232","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/65"},{"abstract":null,"id":1202,"authors":["2338","2391","2427","2171"],"title":"CROCUS: Cluster-based ontology data cleansing","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#WASABI2014Cherix","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469435937361891328","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/WASABI\/2"},{"abstract":null,"id":150,"authors":["2678"],"title":"Ontology Design Patterns: Adoption Challenges and Solutions","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#WASABI2014Hammar","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469435845720567808","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/WASABI\/1"},{"abstract":"Twitter, due to its massive growth as a social networking platform has been in focus to analyze its user generated content for personalization and recommendation tasks. A common challenge across these tasks is identifying user interests from tweets. Lately, semantic enrichment of Twitter posts to determine (entity-based) user interests has been an active area of research. The advantages of these approaches include interoperability, information reuse and the availability of knowledge-bases to be exploited. However, exploiting these knowledge bases for identifying user interests still remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on exploiting hierarchical relationships present in knowledge-bases to infer richer user interests expressed as \\textit{Hierarchical Interest Graph}. We argue that the hierarchical semantics of concepts can enhance the existing systems to personalize or recommend items based on varied level of conceptual abstractness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study which shows an average of approximately eight of the top ten weighted hierarchical interests in the graph being relevant to a given user's interests.","id":1189,"authors":["2687","263","2782","268"],"title":"User Interests Identification on Twitter Using a Hierarchical Knowledge Base","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Kapanipathi","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453669133737922560","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/227"},{"abstract":"A variety of query approaches have been proposed by the semantic web community to explore and query semantic data. Each was developed for a specific task and employed its own interaction mechanism; each query mechanism has its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Most semantic web search systems employ only one approach, thus being unable to exploit the benefits of alternative approaches. Motivated by a usability and interactivity perspective, we propose to combine two query approaches (graph-based and natural language) as a hybrid query approach. In this paper, we present NL-Graphs which aims to exploit the strengths of both approaches, while ameliorating their weaknesses. NL-Graphs was conceptualised and developed from observations, and lessons learned, in several evaluations with expert and casual users. The results of evaluating our approach with expert and casual users on a large semantic dataset are very encouraging; both types of users were highly satisfied and could effortlessly use the hybrid approach to formulate and answer queries.

In this paper, we present a generic approach which addresses this drawback by inserting temporal information into knowledge bases. Our approach combines two types of information to associate RDF triples with time intervals. First, it relies on temporal information gathered from the document Web by an extension of the fact validation framework DeFacto. Second, it harnesses the time information contained in knowledge bases. This knowledge is combined within a three-step approach which comprises the steps matching, selection and merging. We evaluate our approach against a corpus of facts gathered from Yago2 by using DBpedia and Freebase as input and different parameter settings for the underlying algorithms.

This phenomenon, known as co-reference, increases the probability of leaving out implicit semantically related results when querying Linked Data. The probability of co-reference increases further when considering distributed SPARQL queries over a larger set of distributed datasets. Addressing co-reference in Linked Data queries, on one hand, increases complexity of query processing. On the other hand, it requires changes in how statistics of datasets are taken into consideration. We investigate these two challenges of addressing co-reference in distributed SPARQL queries, and propose two methods to improve query efficiency: 1) a model named Virtual Graph, that transforms a query with co-reference into a normal query with pre-existing bindings; 2) an algorithm named $\\Psi$, that intensively exploits parallelism, and dynamically optimises queries using runtime statistics. We deploy both methods in an distributed engine called LHD-d. To evaluate LHD-d, we investigate the distribution of co-reference in the real world, based on which we simulate an experimental RDF network. In this environment we demonstrate the advantages of LHD-d for distributed SPARQL queries in environments with co-reference.","id":114,"authors":["2483","2611","2724"],"title":"Optimising Linked Data Queries Using Runtime Statistics in the Presence of Co-reference","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Wang","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453636927153909760","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/20"},{"abstract":"A primary challenge to Web data integration is coreference resolution, namely identifying entity descriptions from different data sources that refer to the same real-world entity. Increasingly, solutions to coreference resolution have humans in the loop. For instance, many active learning, crowdsourcing, and pay-as-you-go approaches solicit user feedback for verifying candidate coreferent entities computed by automatic methods. Whereas reducing the number of verification tasks is a major consideration for these approaches, very little attention has been paid to the efficiency of performing each single verification task. To address this issue, in this paper, instead of showing the entire descriptions of two entities for verification which are possibly lengthy, we propose to extract and present a compact summary of them, and expect that such length-limited comparative entity summaries can help human users verify more efficiently without significantly hurting the accuracy of their verification. Our approach exploits the common and different features of two entities that best help indicate (non-)coreference, and also considers the diverse information on their identities. Experimental results show that verification is 2.7--2.9 times faster when using our comparative entity summaries, and its accuracy is not notably affected.","id":135,"authors":["2434","2230","2848"],"title":"Facilitating Human Intervention in Coreference Resolution with Comparative Entity Summaries","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#eswc2014Xu","track":"Research Track","twitter_widget":"453638262985216000","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/research\/26"},{"abstract":null,"id":1204,"authors":["2162","2468","2102","2814","2140"],"title":"Semantic Web-based Sentiment Analysis","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Reforgiato","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469435222606348289","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/5"},{"abstract":null,"id":140,"authors":["2547","2546","2652","2267"],"title":"Usage of Abstract Features in Semantic Sentiment Analysis","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Almashraee","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469434845823631362","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/3"},{"abstract":null,"id":1154,"authors":["2305","2179","232","2689","2286"],"title":"Sentiment Analysis for Dynamic User Preference Inference in Spoken Dialogue Systems","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Vanrompay","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469435108542275585","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/4"},{"abstract":null,"id":162,"authors":["2670","2249","2334","2417"],"title":"Adapting Sentiment Lexicons using Contextual Semantics for Twitter Sentiment Analysis","thumbnail":null,"hashtag":"#SSA2014Saif","track":"Workshop Track","twitter_widget":"469434955676647425","uri":"http:\/\/data.semanticweb.org\/conference\/eswc\/2014\/paper\/ws\/SSA\/2"},{"abstract":"This event is not associated to a paper presentation","id":777,"authors":[],"title":"other event","thumbnail":null,"subject":[],"hashtag":"#otherEvent","track":"","twitter_widget":"none","uri":null,"presenter":666}]},
